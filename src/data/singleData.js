    I shot the sheriff, but I didn't shoot no deputy, ooh, ooh, ooh)
    Yeah, all around in my home town
    They're tryin' to track me down
    They say they want to bring me in guilty
    For the killing of a deputy
    For the life of a deputy, but I say
    Oh, now, now, oh
    (I shot the sheriff) the sheriff
    (But I swear it was in self defense) oh, no (oh, oh, ooh)
    Yeah, I say, I shot the sheriff oh, Lord! (and they say it is a capital offense)
    Yeah! (oh, oh, ooh) yeah
    Sheriff John Brown always hated me
    For what, I don't know
    Every time I plant a seed
    He said kill it before it grow
    He said kill them before they grow, and so
    Read it in the news! (I shot the sheriff) oh, Lord
    (But I swear it was in self-defense)
    Where was the deputy? (oh, oh, ooh)
    I say, I shot the sheriff
    But I swear it was in self defense, yeah (ooh)
    Freedom came my way one day
    And I started out of town, yeah
    All of a sudden I saw sheriff John Brown
    Aiming to shoot me down
    So I shot, I shot, I shot him down and I say
    If I am guilty I will pay
    I didn't shoot no deputy (oh, no-oh) oh no
    (I shot the sheriff) I did
    But I didn't shoot no deputy, oh (oh, oh, ooh)
    Reflexes had got the better of me
    And what is to be must be
    Every day the bucket a-go a well
    One day the bottom a-go drop out
    One day the bottom a-go drop out, I say
    I, I, I, I, shot the sheriff
    Lord, I didn't shot the deputy, no
    I, I (shot the sheriff)
    But I didn't shoot no deputy, yeah
    So, yeah`,
